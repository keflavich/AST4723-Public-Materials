# AST4723-Public-Materials

AST 4723 is the second-semester upper-level undergraduate course on astronomical observations.

We cover optical and radio spectroscopy and data analysis.

The notebooks are intended to run with no additional data dependencies (except where noted) and are meant to be displayed as slideshows using [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

Topics are generally presented in this order (partly from necessity to match assignments):

  1. [Spectroscopy 1: Basics of spectroscopy, Spectrograph design, collimation](https://github.com/keflavich/AST4723-Public-Materials/blob/master/Lecture%20-%20Spectroscopy%201%20-%20Spectroscopy%20and%20Spectrograph%20Design%2C%20Collimation%2C%20Diffraction.ipynb)
  2. [Spectroscopy 2: Resolution, Slits](https://github.com/keflavich/AST4723-Public-Materials/blob/master/Lecture%20-%20Spectroscopy%202%20-%20Resolution%2C%20Grating%20Equation%2C%20Slit%20rev2.ipynb)
  3. The [Spectroscopy Data Reduction Tutorial Series](https://github.com/keflavich/AST4723-Public-Materials/tree/master/spectroscopy) gets updated a little with each new spectrograph.  The tutorial series is also hosted on [astropy-learn](learn.astropy.org)
