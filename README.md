# AST4723-Public-Materials

AST 4723 is the second-semester upper-level undergraduate course on astronomical observations.

We cover optical and radio spectroscopy and data analysis.

The notebooks are intended to run with no additional data dependencies and are mean to be displayed as slideshows using [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

Topics are generally presented in this oreder:

 1) [Spectroscopy 1: Basics of spectroscopy, Spectrograph design, collimation](https://github.com/keflavich/AST4723-Public-Materials/blob/master/Lecture%20-%20Spectroscopy%201%20-%20Spectroscopy%20and%20Spectrograph%20Design%2C%20Collimation%2C%20Diffraction.ipynb)
